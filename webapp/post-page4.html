   <p class="post-text">
    Seventeen <b>(Korean: 세븐틴; or as SVT)</b> is a South Korean boy 
    band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: 
    S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, 
    Vernon, and Dino. Seventeen has won a large audience since its debut and has grown 
    into an internationally recognized K-Pop group with signature music and performances.
   </p>
   <p class="post-text">
    Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members involved in 
    songwriting, music production, and choreographing, among other aspects of their music 
    and performances.They perform as one group and are divided into three 
    units—hip-hop, vocal, and performance—each with a different area of specialization. 
    They have been labeled "Performance Kings", "Theater Kids of K-Pop", and "K-Pop 
    Performance Powerhouse'" by various domestic and international media outlets.
