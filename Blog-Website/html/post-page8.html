    group formed by Cube Entertainment in 2018. The group consists of five members: 
    Miyeon, Minnie, Soyeon, Yuqi, and Shuhua. The group was originally a sextet, 
    until Soojin left the group on August 14, 2021. (G)I-dle debuted on May 2, 2018, 
    with the single "Latata" from their first extended play (EP) I Am. They debuted in
